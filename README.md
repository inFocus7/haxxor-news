### My implementation of the final curriculum task using ReactJS + Bootstrap since I'm not the best a stylings.

# Routes
## /
Fetches the top stories and displays them.


## /new
Fetches latest stories and displays them.


## /user/:id
Fetches user alongside user information (their submissions) and displays them.


# TODO:
- Asynchronously fetch & display submissions to increase loading speeds.
- Implement post page
- Implement Links on text (on user + comments)
- Add a Tooltip to some badges

# NOTE:
My implementations are kind of bad, still getting used to doing this on my own. I spent a lot of time with promises since I still don't fully understand how they work, so my async loading implementation might take a while.
